In the first task I have used simple logic of when the remainder of a division is 0 then the even will be printed under if, or else will be printed.
In task 2, I have used a variable name sum, then in for loop a range is created from 1 to 51 ( to include 50 as well), then with each itration, that itration or value is added into the sum this goes in loop until the last value in range is achieved. then finally the sum is printed with the value.
