in task1, i created a dictonary with dict and provided it with some keys and vales, then used x as an user calling, and while printing i used dict.get(x) this is that when x given a vaild key triggers the .get function it provides with the value of that key and then give it as answer.
in task2. I created a list from 1 to 10, then used x as new variable then sliced the list by[:5] from 0 to 5th index value. then printed the x, while slicing the newly made sliced list till 5 i used a different approach by, first i created a variable y in which the list will be again sliced till 5th index number, then i used the step logic of -1 to revese the list.
